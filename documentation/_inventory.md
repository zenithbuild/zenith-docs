# Docs Inventory

## Contract: Inventory Scope

Contract: Inventory tracks canonical docs and legacy docs that require rewrite, deprecation, or deletion.

Invariant: Canonical docs under `content/docs` are the source of truth for contracts.

Definition of Done:
- Canonical contract/reference/guide docs are listed as keep.
- Legacy contradictory docs are marked rewrite or deprecate.
